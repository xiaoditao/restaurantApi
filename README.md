This is the simple restaurant api

There are 2 folders, one for client, one for server
I already deploy the server to heroku, so when running the project, we don't need to run the server locally, only need to download the client side files.

- If you have NetBeans, please clone the RestaurantApiClient folder, zip it, open NetBeans,
Click File -> import Project -> From zip, and choose the zip file
run this project to start the client side
- If you have eclipse, please create a new project in eclipse, go to RestaurantApiClient folder -> src -> RestaurantApiClient.java, download RestaurantApiClient.java and paste it in your project, run the java file to start the client side; Also, please go to RestaurantApiClient folder -> lib -> java-json.jar, download the jar and import it into your project
